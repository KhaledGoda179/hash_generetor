# Hash Generator

Hash Generator is an Android Kotlin project designed to facilitate the generation of hash values for plain text using various hash algorithms such as SHA-256, SHA-512, and MD5.

## Features

- Generate hash values for plain text using SHA-256, SHA-512, and MD5 algorithms.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Lightweight and efficient implementation in Kotlin for Android.

## Usage

1. Enter the plain text you want to hash into the input field.
2. Select the desired hash algorithm (SHA-256, SHA-512, or MD5).
3. Tap on the "Generate Hash" button.
4. The generated hash value will be displayed on the screen.
